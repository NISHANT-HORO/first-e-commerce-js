# Demo eCommerce Web Shop

This is a fully functional eCommerce website (except for the checkout part to avoid actual transaction).

The final checkout transaction can be mocked using [Stripe's test card details](https://stripe.com/docs/testing)
Card number - 4242 4242 4242 4242
MM / YY     - 04 / 24
CVC         - 242
ZIP         - 42424
